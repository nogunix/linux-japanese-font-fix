# Linux Japanese Font Fix

A robust Fontconfig setting to fix common Japanese font rendering issues (e.g., the "Chinese font problem") on Fedora systems, particularly when using a non-Japanese locale.

## The Problem

On a fresh installation of Fedora with a non-Japanese locale (e.g., English), the system may default to using Chinese fonts to display Japanese characters. This happens because the default font priority is not optimized for Japanese, leading to incorrect character shapes (e.g., `直` or `骨`).

This issue has been confirmed on **Fedora 42**. It occurs because the default Noto CJK font package includes glyphs for Japanese, Chinese, and Korean in a single file. For systems with a non-Japanese locale, Fontconfig can easily select the incorrect glyphs for Japanese text.

## Before and After

**Before (Incorrect Chinese Glyphs):**

**After (Correct Japanese Glyphs):**

## The Solution

This configuration (`50-user-jp-fonts.conf`) forces the system to use the high-quality Noto CJK JP fonts for Japanese rendering.

-   **For Web Browsing:** It assigns `Noto Sans CJK JP` and `Noto Serif CJK JP` to the generic `sans-serif` and `serif` families, ensuring stable rendering in browsers.
-   **For Developers:** It sets up a sophisticated `monospace` configuration that prioritizes `Noto Sans Mono` for code (for maximum readability of Latin characters and symbols) and seamlessly falls back to `Noto Sans Mono CJK JP` for Japanese comments.

    > **Note:** This configuration is optimized for systems where `Noto Sans Mono` is the default monospace font, as is common on Fedora. You can check your system's default by running `fc-match monospace`. If the output is different, you may need to adjust the font names in `50-user-jp-fonts.conf` accordingly.

## Prerequisites

This configuration is intended for **Fedora 42**. You need to have the Noto CJK variable fonts installed.

**On Fedora:**
```bash
# Install the necessary Noto fonts (this is a single command):
sudo dnf install google-noto-sans-cjk-vf-fonts google-noto-serif-cjk-vf-fonts google-noto-sans-mono-fonts google-noto-sans-mono-cjk-jp-fonts
```

## Installation

You can install this configuration for a single user.

1.  Create the configuration directory if it doesn't exist:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d
    ```

2.  Copy the font configuration file:
    ```bash
    cp 50-user-jp-fonts.conf ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/
    ```

3.  Rebuild the font cache:
    ```bash
    fc-cache -fv
    ```

4.  Restart your applications (or log out and log back in) to see the changes.
